All the necessary steps for the **filtering** of the mutational variants obtained by the variant caller (Mutect2) and annotated by SNPEff/SNPSift, can be found in this folder. Even so, and as indicated in the report, an extra file is added, with the steps or changes that must be made if instead of working with **Target Sequencing** data, you work with **WES** data.
