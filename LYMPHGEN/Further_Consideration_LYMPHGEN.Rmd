Although the Arm Flat file is not required, it improves the prediction of the A53 subtypes. So, it is recommended if CN is included.

```{r}
library(data.table)

# Download cytoband file from the UCSC web browser:
x <- fread("http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/database/cytoBand.txt.gz",
           col.names = c("chrom","chromStart","chromEnd","name","gieStain"))

arms <- x[ , .(length = sum(chromEnd - chromStart)), by = .(chrom, arm = substring(name, 1, 1)) ] # We create the object arm with the length for each of them

# As we define an arm as having a change in CN if more than 80% of the length of the arm has the change:
"80%" <-min(arms$length)*0.80 # Indication of the minimum arms length.
CNA <- read.table("Copynumberalt.txt", header = T, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = F)
CNA <- CNA[!CNA$event == "LOH",] # We do not consider those LOH events.
head(CNA)

# First, we consider those rows in CNA which refer to p arm:
Parm <- lapply(c(1:nrow(CNA)), function(x){
  chr <- CNA[x,2]
  arm <-arms[arms$chrom == chr & arms$arm == "p",]$length
  return(arm)
})

CNA$p <- unlist(Parm)

# Then, we perform the same procedure but for the q arm.
Qarm <- lapply(c(1:nrow(CNA)), function(x){
  chr <- CNA[x,2]
  arm <-arms[arms$chrom == chr & arms$arm == "q",]$length
  return(arm)
})
CNA$q <- unlist(Qarm)

# Finally, we have to compute the percentages for each p and q arms by the 80% stablished. 
CNA$ppercentage <- CNA$length > (CNA$p*0.8)
CNA$qpercentage <- CNA$length > (CNA$q*0.8)
write.csv(CNA, file = "ARM-CNA.csv") # It can now be uploaded at Lymphgen tool.
```
