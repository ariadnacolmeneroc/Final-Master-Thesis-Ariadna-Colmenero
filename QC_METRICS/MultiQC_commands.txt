MultiQC is a tool to create a single report with interactive plots for multiple bioinformatics 
analyses across many samples (see all the used code at:  https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC). Although 
it is straightforward and easy to use, we need a previous installation of different modules.
All this code was launched in the terminal using Ubuntu 18.04.5 on Windows.
"""

##
# Installing MultiQC
##

# First, we have to clone the code and install the code by ourselves:
git clone https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC.git # Clone the given repository.
cd MultiQC # Move to the correct folder.
pip install . # MultiQC installation.

# At first, this code caused problems and it was decided to download the compressed files and extract the flat files.

curl -LOk https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd MultiQC-master
pip install .

# In addition, the following modules had to be installed and updated:
python3 setup.py install
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install numpy
sudo pip3 install networkx
sudo pip3 install matplotlib
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
sudo sudo pip3 install coloredlogs
sudo pip3 install colormath
sudo pip3 install pygments
sudo pip3 install dataclasses

# Finally, we could run multiqc. It is very important that we must indicate the folder where the files we want to analyse are located.
multiqc ../BAMS_QC/

root@DESKTOP-IIG3TJF:/mnt/c/Users/User/Desktop/MultiQC# multiqc ../BAMS_QC/

# If the code is running properly you should see:

/// MultiQC 🔍 | v1.13.dev0
